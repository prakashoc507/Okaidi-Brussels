        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>Soutien Belge OverSeas known as SB Overseas began <br> as community effort amongst concerned citizens in Brussels who <br> decided to intervene in the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Middle East. <br> As these efforts grew in involvement and impact, something became increasingly <br> obvious: providing a safe environment for children was a short-term solution, <br> but there was no long term hope for a generation of kids who had had their education interrupted by the war. <br> It became clear that an entire generation of children were being left on <br> the sidelines of society not equipped with the skills or opportunities to <br> regain control of their lives. With this in mind, SB OverSeas <br> opened its first school in Lebanon, home to over 1,5 million Syrian refugees. <br>  Since opening our first school, we have expanded to having <br> three schools in Shatila, Arsal and Saida. We have also expanded our <br> programs to provide vocational courses to adults as well as empowerment <br> courses to combat the increasingly prevalent practice of child marriage. <br> Our headquarters are located in Brussels, Belgium where we coordinate these activities <br> as well as running our SB Espoir project, a weekend integration program <br> with unaccompanied minors living in asylum-centres.</p>
