## INITIAL IDEA CONCEPT

My initial idea for the project was to develop a website so that we can make people aware of the utility of their used clothes. On a daily basis i see people throwing their used usable clothes. So, my website is for any person who is willing to give clothes rather than just dumping them.

The person can be of any gender or age. For this i have designed my website with appropriate effects and tools so that they can have easy access if they  want to make a donation. 

### Visitors Goal
* To easily understand the purpose of the site.
* To make site easy to read.
* Easy access to nav bar so that browser can easily navigate different pages.
* Interesting color combination and motivating content.
