            <h3>Who we are</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>Petit Clothing known as PC Overseas began <br> as community effort amongst concerned citizens in
                Brussels who <br> decided to intervene in the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Middle East. <br> As
                these efforts grew in involvement and impact, something became increasingly <br> obvious: providing a
                safe environment for children was a short-term solution, <br> but there was no long term hope for a
                generation of kids who had had their education interrupted by the war. <br> It became clear that an
                entire generation of children were being left on <br> the sidelines of society not equipped with the
                skills or opportunities to <br> regain control of their lives. With this in mind, SB OverSeas <br>
                opened its first school in Lebanon, home to over 1,5 million Syrian refugees. <br> Since opening our
                first school, we have expanded to having <br> three schools in Shatila, Arsal and Saida. We have also
                expanded our <br> programs to provide vocational courses to adults as well as empowerment <br> courses
                to combat the increasingly prevalent practice of child marriage. <br> Our headquarters are located in
                Brussels, Belgium where we coordinate these activities <br> as well as running our project, a
                weekend integration program <br> with unaccompanied minors living in asylum-centres.</p>
